Keep in mind that TopHat uses a custom Prelude, so you will have to use a mixin or some other solution. Usage The library exposes a single function: visualizeTask . The library will spin up a web server to visualize the passed task. By default, the application can be accessed at http://localhost:3000 . The port number can be changed by passing it as an environment variable, e.g.: PORT=3001 stack run Consider the following example: {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} import Task (Task, enter, view, (>>?)) import Visualize (visualizeTask) main :: IO () main = visualizeTask greet greet :: Task h Text greet = (question >< promptName) >>? \\(_, name) -> view (\"Hello, \" <> name) where question :: Task h Text question = view \"What is your name?\" promptName :: Task h Text promptName = enter This will produce the following application when run:","title":"Installation & usage"},{"location":"usage/#installation-usage","text":"","title":"Installation &amp; Usage"},{"location":"usage/#installation","text":"The project is currently untested as a library, however it should just work.
