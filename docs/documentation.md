# Documentation

Documentation is generated from the `docs` folder using
[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). When making documentation changes, you can
run the following to get a local preview:

```
mkdocs serve
```

Once everything looks good, the changes can be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch
with the following command:

```
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
