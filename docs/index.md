# TopHat Visualizations

Interactive visualizations of [TopHat](https://github.com/timjs/tophat-haskell)

This library exposes the `visualizeTask` function, which creates a web
application for the given task. Examples can be found in the [`app`](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/ou-afstuderen-artefact/tree/master/app)
